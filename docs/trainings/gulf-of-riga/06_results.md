# Findings & Future Directions

## Key Findings

The automated DGA workflow was applied to historical data spanning 30 years.

### The "Water Darkening" Confirmed
*   **Trend**: The Mann-Kendall analysis showed a significant **negative trend** in Secchi depth.
*   **Interpretation**: Water transparency is decreasing (the water is getting darker/murkier).
*   **Location**: The trend is most pronounced in the **eastern coastal regions** of the Gulf of Riga.

This quantitative result confirms the initial qualitative observations ("gut feelings") of the scuba divers.

## Future Research Questions

The workflow established *what* is happening. Future work aims to understand *why*:
1.  **Drivers**: What specific optical properties are changing?
2.  **Catchment Linkage**: How do land-use changes and runoff in the **Daugava River catchment** influence these marine changes?
3.  **Scalability**: Testing this workflow in other regions (North Sea, Mediterranean) to see if it applies elsewhere.

## Conclusion

The AquaINFRA "Gulf of Riga" use case demonstrates how **FAIR data services** and **Virtual Research Environments (VREs)** can empower researchers. By automating the path from "raw data" to "trend detection," scientists can focus on interpreting the ecological story—turning a diver's observation into actionable scientific knowledge.
