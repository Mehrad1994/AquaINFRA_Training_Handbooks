# Introduction to Pan-European Use Case

The **Pan-European Biodiversity** use case focuses on creating larger scale, more robust estimates of biodiversity all across Europe by including fragmented datasets.

## The Goal
The primary objective is to empower *marine and freshwater scientists* and stakeholders to:
*   Store, share, and access research data.
*   Analyze and process digital research objects.
*   Restore healthy aquatic ecosystems, oceans, seas, and inland waters.

## The Virtual Environment
The AquaINFRA project is developing a virtual environment featuring **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) multidisciplinary data and services. This environment facilitates collaboration across:
1.  Different research infrastructures.
2.  Scientific fields.
3.  National borders.

It leverages the **European Open Science Cloud (EOSC)** and other existing operational data spaces.

## Focus of this Training
This training handbook concentrates on the **Pan-European Use Case**, providing:
*   A compelling backstory about freshwater biodiversity.
*   A comprehensive overview of the **Data to Knowledge Package**.
*   A walkthrough of the developed workflow involved.

In the next chapter, we will travel to the beautiful city of Vienna to meet the team at BOKU University.
