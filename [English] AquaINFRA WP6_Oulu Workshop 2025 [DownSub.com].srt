1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,440
The Aqua Infra project aims to develop a virtual environment equipped with fair

2
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:17,680
multidisciplinary data and services to support marine and freshwater scientists

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,439
and stakeholders in restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters.

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,760
The Aqua Infra virtual environment will enable the target stakeholders to store,

5
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,840
share, access, analyze and process research data and other research digital

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,520
objects from their own discipline across research infrastructures, disciplines

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,200
and national borders leveraging on EOS and the other existing operational data

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,920
spaces. Aqua Infra is addressing the specific need for enabling researchers

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,960
from the marine and freshwater communities to work and collaborate across those two

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,080
domains. a set of strategic use cases, including a Pan European use case as well

11
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,720
as more focused use cases in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea, and the

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,600
Mediterranean, will provide the setting for co-designing and testing services in the targeted research communities. This

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,920
training video focuses on the Gulf of Riga and the Daugava River catchment use case in the Baltic Sea region. by

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,439
presenting the story behind this compelling use case and its developed workflow. We will also introduce key

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,040
components of the Aqua Infra interaction platform and demonstrate how the data to

16
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,720
knowledge package concept is implemented within the Aqua Infra project. Coming up

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,840
next, the lead scientist involved in the research and development of this use case will present the story and outline

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,039
the main research

19
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:13,200
question. Hello, my name is Astra Labuce and I'm a researcher at Latvian

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,080
Institute of Aquatic Ecology. I'm currently involved in the Aqua Info project. Within this project,

21
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,239
researchers across Europe are working on many research questions and issues. And in our case, the research question began

22
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,280
with the story. A few years ago, scuba divers from our institute shared a personal

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,920
observation that the underwater world in the Gulf of Riga was becoming darker.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,480
Naturally, there could be many explanations. One explanation they joked is that they are simply getting older

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
and their eyesight isn't what it used to be. But even so, the observation raised

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,239
a serious hypothesis. To begin answering the question, do the optical properties in

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,720
the Gulf of Riga change over the long term. We developed a reproducible and reusable workflow as part of Aqua

28
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:12,040
project. And because the largest river flowing into the Gulf of Riga is the river Daugava, we call this DGA

29
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:20,280
workflow. This workflow includes temporal and spatial aggregation, data interpolation, trend analysis, and some

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,760
visualizations. A key data set in this use case is the Secchi depth measurements. It's obtained by a simple method using a

31
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,360
Secchi disc. Basically, a black and white disc is lowered into the water and we

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,760
record the depth where it's no longer visible. And this shows us how transparent the water is and helps us

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,200
understand the amount of algae, tiny particles, and organic matter floating in it. The Gulf of Riga is a unique

34
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,840
marine environment. It's shallow, semi-enclosed, and exchanges water slowly with the open Baltic Sea. Because

35
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,239
of that, it's more strongly impacted by river runoffs and land-based activities. and seasonal changes like spring

36
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,439
nutrient inputs, summer algal blooms or winter ice have a major influence on its ecology. That's why time and seasonality

37
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,840
are central to our analysis. Coming up next, the Aqua Infra interaction

38
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:21,959
platform and the data to knowledge package related to the Gulf of Riga use case will be introduced.

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,240
This is the starting page of the Aqua Infra interaction platform. It serves as

40
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,000
the central gateway for scientific communities to find, access, and reuse

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,919
aquatic digital resources such as research data, tools, and workflows

42
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,919
associated with the Aqua Infra project. On the starting page, you will also find

43
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,120
basic training videos provided by the Aqua Infra development team offering

44
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,400
guidance on how to use the platform. Let's begin by exploring the search functionality to find resources related

45
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,400
to the Gulf of Riga workflow. In the search bar, enter your search term.

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,120
After clicking search, you will be redirected to a page where the search results are displayed.

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,960
To locate the data to knowledge package associated with the Gulf of Riga workflow, use data to knowledge as your

48
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,639
search term. On the search results page, you will find several options to filter

49
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,039
your results. First, there is the ontology search feature which categorizes the

50
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,160
results into four groups based on the relationship to the search term. You can

51
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,720
also filter results by data providers. The Aqua Infra interaction platform

52
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,280
includes resources from several data providers such as Inspire, Arctic Data

53
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:06,479
Center, Copernicus Marine, HELCOM, and EMODnet. You can narrow your search by

54
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,080
selecting one or more specific data providers. In addition, you can explore

55
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,120
the spatial coverage of the search results using the interactive map. You

56
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,919
can further refine your search area by selecting a European catchment

57
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,080
area or by drawing a custom bounding

58
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,759
box for our search related to the Gulf of Riga workflow. Select Zenodo as the

59
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,840
data provider and click search again to focus the results. All the necessary

60
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,639
materials to run and reproduce the Gulf of Riga workflow are available through the data to knowledge package for

61
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,800
reproducible spatiotemporal trend detection analysis. A data to knowledge package

62
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,240
links data and computational code to support a reproducible spatiotemporal

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,360
trend detection analysis. The selected package is specifically

64
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,639
designed to structure and integrate meta objects, providing a framework for

65
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,400
addressing the research question, do the optical properties in the Gulf of Riga in

66
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,720
the Baltic Sea change over the long term? Within the package, you will find

67
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,400
a step-by-step guide on how to run the workflow. You will also find links to a

68
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,440
MyBinder-based virtual lab and detailed information on the developed web API

69
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,800
services available in the virtual research environment section. The virtual lab provides a computational

70
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,240
environment based on the reproducible source code and data. It offers users a

71
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,160
ready to use setup with pre-installed packages allowing them to work with the

72
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:05,599
code directly within the MyBinder computational environment. In the web API section, you

73
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,080
can explore the toolbox associated with Spatio-temporal trend detection

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,879
analysis. It is accessible through platforms such as Zenodo and GitHub.

75
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,000
The toolbox includes a set of predefined functions designed for reproducible data

76
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:29,840
processing, statistical assessment, and visualization of results. It acts as the

77
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,200
computational backbone of the workflow, supporting the identification of long-term trends across spatial and

78
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,760
temporal scales. Finally, in the reproducible basis section, you will find detailed

79
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,839
information about the toolbox and the input data sets required to run the

80
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,519
workflow. The workflow is the first entry point for users to get an overview of the

81
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:02,080
analysis. To learn more about the data to knowledge package concept and how the workflow is structured, you can read the

82
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,080
open access method article written by the Aqua Infra development team. The

83
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,120
article is titled encouraging reusability of computational research

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,880
through data to knowledge packages a hydrological use case. Next we will

85
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,080
explore Aqua Galaxy the main component of the Aqua Infra virtual research

86
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:33,959
environment. We'll also take a closer look at the workflow section within the selected data to knowledge package.

87
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:49,480
Before starting a comprehensive review of the workflow components and steps, you first need to register in the Aqua

88
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,640
Galaxy. The Aqua Galaxy is a virtual research environment developed within

89
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,839
the Aqua Infra project. It is a subdomain within open-source web-based

90
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,080
Galaxy platform. It consists of a set of tools to analyze multidisciplinary fair

91
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,680
data and services to support marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders

92
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,800
in restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal and inland waters. The virtual

93
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,320
environment will enable target stakeholders to store, share, access,

94
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,560
analyze, and process research data and other digital research objects.

95
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,920
You can register here by filling in the required information. By staying signed in to

96
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Aqua Galaxy, you can directly import the workflow and most of the Aqua Infra data

97
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,920
sets into the Aqua Infra research environment. We return to the data to

98
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,600
knowledge package page in the Aqua Infra interaction platform. Here by clicking

99
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,959
on the workflow you have several options to get detailed information about the workflow and to access and download

100
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:11,040
associated files. Selecting the Aqua Infra will take you to the workflow page on the interaction platform and the

101
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:20,519
detailed information about the workflow for Spatio-temporal trend detection analysis is provided on this page.

102
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,560
It also provides access to the workflow repository page in Zenodo. Here you have

103
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:34,120
access to the information about the workflow components and you can download the repository as a zip

104
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,360
file. It includes files such as text files including links to the results of

105
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,399
each step of the workflow to make it reproducible. The other file is the workflow file

106
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,519
compatible with the Aqua Galaxy and it can be used to import the workflow into

107
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,279
the virtual research environment. The other two options

108
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:04,519
associated with the workflow in the data to knowledge package page will take you to the reviewed repository page in

109
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:10,399
Zenodo and the workflow preview page in Aqua Galaxy. Next, we will explore the

110
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,240
workflow input data sets and learn how to import them into the Aqua Infra virtual research

111
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:37,320
environment. To begin running the workflow, we'll follow the steps outlined in the data to knowledge package.

112
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,480
Step one is to make sure you're signed into Aqua

113
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:56,760
Galaxy. Next, we need to import the required input data into the virtual research environment.

114
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,560
To import the point input data related to water transparency and Secchi measurements, start by clicking on

115
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,279
Latvian Secchi depth and water color. This gives you access to three

116
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:19,279
options. One is a direct download link for the point data. Another takes you to the Zenodo

117
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,920
page for the data to knowledge input data sets.

118
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,240
This includes both the Latvian Secchi depth and water color data set as well as the

119
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:37,519
HELCOM subbasins data set which can be downloaded here. Through the third one you can

120
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,880
visit the data set page on the aqua infra interaction platform where you'll

121
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:50,240
find basic details such as spatial coverage and metadata information. Since this data set is

122
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,839
already part of Aqua Infra, you can import it directly into Aqua Galaxy by

123
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:03,440
clicking the import to Galaxy. This opens the OGC API features

124
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:12,000
sub setting window where you can filter and select the data that will be imported. Here you can define a bounding

125
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,279
box to limit spatial coverage. Select the number of data points to

126
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,360
import or filter attributes using query

127
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,920
parameters. To answer the research question, we need all available data points

128
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,279
5,871 in total. So set the point number to

129
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:46,480
5,871. Click regenerate to receive the updated link. Then click import.

130
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:54,720
You will be redirected to the virtual research environment. The import may take some time to be deployed and be

131
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,240
implemented on the servers and be completed. Here in the history section,

132
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,160
a gray box means the step is cued. Orange means it's currently processing.

133
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Green means the step is complete. And if there's an issue, the box will turn red.

134
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,320
Now let's return to the data to knowledge page to import the second data

135
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,199
set. Clicking on the second data set gives you similar

136
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:35,360
options. Click on the Aqua Infra to get access to the data set page on the interaction

137
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,199
platform where basic metadata is available.

138
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:53,199
Click visit to explore the original metadata. You'll find two useful links

139
00:15:54,199 --> 00:15:59,920
here. One, a direct link to access the data

140
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:06,480
set. Two, a link to the HELCOM interactive map. Since this data set is

141
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,759
provided by HELCOM, it's not directly accessible through Aqua Infra data sets.

142
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:18,480
So you need to accept a data usage disclaimer first and follow some additional steps to import it into Aqua

143
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,680
Galaxy. The reason for this complexity is that some data providers do not yet

144
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,600
offer their data in a fully accessible or machine readable format.

145
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,040
To address this, the Aqua Infra development team must include additional

146
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,240
steps to ensure the data can be properly integrated and used within the virtual research environment. First, open the

147
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:50,519
direct download link from the metadata page in a new browser tab. Then accept the data usage

148
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:56,880
disclaimer. The download link will activate shortly afterward.

149
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,959
You don't need to download the file to your computer. Just copy the activated download

150
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:09,038
link. Return to the data set page on the interaction platform and paste the link into the

151
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,760
import field. Then click import. This will import the second data set into the

152
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,959
virtual research environment. Once the data is imported, it appears under a generic name like

153
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,280
Aqua Infra resource. It is a good idea to rename it for clarity. Click edit,

154
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,960
then rename the first data set to something meaningful, for example,

155
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:42,720
points. You can also add additional info or annotations

156
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:49,120
here. Once the box for the second data set turns green, go ahead and rename

157
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,200
this one to region. By clicking on the eye icon within each green box, you can access

158
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:01,679
the output. These are usually text files which include a link to the output of

159
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,000
each step. It's important to note that the data itself is not imported into the

160
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:15,919
Galaxy platform. Instead, users import only the access URL to the data. This

161
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,000
URL is then passed to the OGCAPI process which executes the

162
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,600
function and downloads the data as part of the process. For the point data set,

163
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:35,200
open the output link in a new browser tab to review it. You'll see that the Latvian Secchi depth and watercolor data

164
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,200
set is a point layer. Each point includes attributes such as latitude,

165
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:50,799
longitude, visit date, color ID, and transparency measured using the Saki

166
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,679
method. The second input data set provided by HELCOM includes water

167
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,480
assessment units at scale 4 delivered as a zip file. Inside it, you'll find a shape file of

168
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,240
the division of the Baltic Sea into 17 subbasins and further division into

169
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,000
coastal and offshore areas and division of the coastal areas by WFD water types

170
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,559
or water bodies.

171
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,720
As you can see, the import process for the second data set is completed and the

172
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,720
box turned green. As planned, let's rename it to

173
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:44,720
regions. The input data have been imported into the Aqua Infra virtual research environment. Let's return to

174
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,440
the interaction platform and import the workflow.

175
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:11,280
to import the workflow. In the workflow section in the interaction platform, click on Galaxy. As we've reviewed, this

176
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,320
will redirect you to the workflow preview page in Aqua Galaxy. Click on

177
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,520
import to complete the import process. On the next page, click on start using

178
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,480
this workflow and you'll be redirected to the main workflow section within Aqua

179
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,159
Galaxy. Alternatively, you can import the workflow manually. In the workflow section, each

180
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:41,159
workflow comes with multiple options. You can copy, download, share, or edit

181
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:47,320
them. By clicking edit, you can explore details about each workflow

182
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:55,159
component. Selecting a specific component reveals information about the step annotations and the underlying

183
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:00,640
processes. Let's run the workflow now. While it's running, we'll walk through

184
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:07,360
each component and step. Click run the workflow. You'll be taken to a page

185
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,600
where you can select input data. These data sets have already been

186
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:18,799
imported. Choose the point data set and the shape file polygons as region data.

187
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:24,280
Here another option is available for users by clicking on expand to full

188
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,400
workflow. You can also modify the input parameters for each step of the

189
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,919
workflow. After selecting the appropriate files, click run workflow.

190
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:42,799
You'll be taken to a progress page where you can monitor scheduled, running, and completed steps both through an

191
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:48,159
interactive workflow graph and the history section. The workflow begins

192
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:55,120
with the two input data sets, the point data and the polygon data. Next, the

193
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:03,520
pre-processing stage begins with spatial aggregation. In this step in situ, environmental data

194
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:08,919
points are assigned to spatial units based on the boundaries of the assessment unit

195
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:14,799
polygons. The data sets are merged and a new attribute is added to each point to

196
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,919
reflect its associated assessment unit. Clicking on each workflow step

197
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,760
shows details about inputs, outputs, and job metrics on the servers.

198
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,159
The next pre-processing step is temporal aggregation. It assigns a season to each

199
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,280
point based on the visit date and defined season's time interval. The output now includes a season attribute

200
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:47,679
for each data point. Then the data analysis starts. The first step is

201
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,080
calculate mean values by group one. Using the temporally aggregated data, it

202
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,400
calculates the average transparency for each group defined by season, year,

203
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,520
assessment unit ID, and location, and outputs the results as a CSV file. The

204
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,120
following step, calculate mean values by group 2, builds on this by further

205
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,720
averaging values for each assessment unit ID across seasons and years. The

206
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,400
result is a structured CSV file where each record corresponds to a single

207
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,640
transparency value for a specific unit, year, and season based on available

208
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:39,520
data. The next step is focusing on selecting time series with sufficient data and interpolating missing values.

209
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,559
First, any assessment unit with fewer than 10 data points is excluded.

210
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:52,440
Moreover, this step will analyze the available data points within each assessment unit through time series

211
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,400
length, which is the difference between the first and last year with data. If

212
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,480
the share of missing data is over 80% of the time series length, that unit is

213
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:11,279
also excluded. For the remaining units, missing values are interpolated across

214
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:16,799
the time series. This results in a structured time series data set

215
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:24,520
optimized for trend detection. The final data analysis step is Mann-Kendall trend

216
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,679
analysis. This non-parametric statistical test detects whether a data

217
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,600
set shows a significant upward or downward trend over time. The final

218
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,200
section of the workflow is visualization. It contains two steps.

219
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:48,720
The first uses the assessment unit polygons and the results from the spatial aggregation step to create an

220
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:54,880
interactive map. The second visualizes the man Kendall analysis results by

221
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,400
generating a bar chart that displays Kendall's tow values for the accepted

222
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:09,720
assessment unit. Next, we'll review the workflow results and wrap up this training video.

223
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,520
As you can see, all the boxes have turned green, indicating that every step of the workflow has been completed

224
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:29,919
successfully. Let's now review the results. By clicking on the eye icon in

225
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,520
each box, we can access the outputs, which are simple text files containing

226
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,039
links to the result of each step. Let's examine the result of the final

227
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:48,320
step in the data analysis, the man Kendall trend analysis. Clicking the provided link

228
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,440
will open a CSV file in a new browser tab and it will be downloaded

229
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,679
automatically. You can open this file in Excel or any other software that supports CSV files.

230
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,799
The Mann-Kendall trend test is a statistical method used to detect whether there is a

231
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:13,039
consistent increasing or decreasing trend in a time series of data such as

232
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,480
temperature, rainfall or water transparency. It is especially useful

233
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:26,320
for environmental and climate data because it does not require the data to follow a normal distribution and can

234
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,919
handle missing values or outliers. The test compares all possible pairs of

235
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,640
data points in the time series to determine if values tend to increase or decrease over time. The result is

236
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,320
expressed as a tow value which ranges from minus1 to + one. A tow value close to + one

237
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,559
indicates a strong increasing trend. A tow value close to minus1 indicates a

238
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,600
strong decreasing trend. A value near zero means there is no consistent trend.

239
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,039
The test also produces a p value which shows whether the trend is statistically

240
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:12,279
significant. If the p value is less than 0.05, the trend is considered

241
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:17,360
significant. In the results file, you will find the tow values and p values

242
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,080
for each accepted assessment unit with sufficient data. Now let's check the

243
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:29,640
visualization and identify which units show statistically significant changes in water

244
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,960
transparency. To do this, open the bar plot output by clicking on the eye icon

245
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,799
in the related box and follow the URL provided. As you can see, the bar chart

246
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,400
presents the trend analysis results using the same CSV file.

247
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:52,200
Units with statistically insignificant trends are shown with translucent

248
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:58,279
colors. Units with significant trends, meaning a p value below

249
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:05,440
0.05, are shown with solid fil bars. In this example, all three significant

250
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,039
results show a negative trend, which means water transparency has decreased.

251
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,919
Specifically, we observe negative trends in summer at

252
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,360
LA-00003 and LAT-004 and a similar negative trend in

253
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,480
autumn at LA-00005. Let's locate these three

254
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,520
assessment units on the interactive map generated by the workflow. Click the

255
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,640
output link provided in the relevant workflow step that is named map shape

256
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:44,320
file points. As you can see, all three assessment units are located along the

257
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:52,760
Latvian coastline. The LAT-05 unit includes the Daugava River

258
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:59,200
catchment which covers the coastal area near Ria, the capital of Latvia.

259
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,840
With this example, we have demonstrated how the data to knowledge package and workflow support the application of fair

260
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,200
principles in the Aqua Infra project. All data software and

261
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,320
processing steps are findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.

262
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:25,399
For example, in the workflow run page, you can substitute your own data set that is compatible with this

263
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:32,159
workflow by clicking on expand to full workflow form. You can also adjust all

264
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,600
input parameters for each step such as the threshold for missing values or the

265
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:44,159
minimum number of data points for the interpolation step. This allows you to customize the

266
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,919
workflow for your own research. The workflow is designed to be generic,

267
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:56,000
so you can reuse it in different regions such as the Gulf of Finland or apply it

268
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,840
to analyze trends in other variables like temperature. Additionally, in the tools

269
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,679
section of Aqua Galaxy, you can search for Aqua Infra to access all the

270
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,720
developed OGCAPI processes used in the workflow.

271
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,200
Each process can be customized and used independently or integrated into new

272
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,320
workflows by adopting OGCAPI standards. These processes are

273
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,120
fully compatible with other initiatives such as the European digital twin of the

274
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,080
ocean. Let's conclude this training video by returning to the research story.

275
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,159
Based on the identified significant trends, the first research question addressed in this video has been

276
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,679
answered. Let's hear how Astra addresses the reviewed research question using the

277
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,799
results of the workflow. And I have to say that trend analysis confirmed the diverse intuition. Transparency is

278
00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:00,320
decreasing and watercolor is changing in some of the regions in the Gulf of Riga.

279
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,360
But this is just the beginning. Our main research question is what environmental

280
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,480
processes are driving these changes in optical properties and how are they

281
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,520
connected to seasonal and land-based influences. So what began with a

282
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,200
divers's personal feeling has grown into a scientific investigation and we as a researchers

283
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,360
are excited to keep diving deeper. Astra and her research team will

284
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,480
continue this research by exploring the following questions. What explanatory components contribute

285
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,679
to the change in water optical properties? Are there any indications of

286
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,159
changes in riverine loads or concentrations of these components in rivers discharging into the Gulf of

287
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,200
Ria? Which activities and pressures such as land use or climate change are most

288
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,840
likely affecting the water's optical properties? And finally, which

289
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,080
socioeconomic drivers influence those activities? This video was created as

290
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,039
part of the Aqua Infra work package 6 led by the Bochum University of Applied

291
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:17,919
Sciences. On behalf of the Aqua Infra team, thank you for watching this training video. We appreciate your

292
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:25,679
interest in the Aqua Infra project and we hope it supports your research and encourages further exploration of Aqua

293
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,039
Infra tools and services. Together, let's make data driven research

294
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,799
fair and more impactful.
