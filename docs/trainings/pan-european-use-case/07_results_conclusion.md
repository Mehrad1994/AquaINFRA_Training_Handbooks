# Results Included

Once the workflow run is complete (all steps are green), you can visualize and export the results.

## Visualizing Results
1.  Click on the final step (Flag Outliers).
2.  Select the **Eye Icon** (View Data).
3.  This will display the resulting table, which now includes:
    *   Original species data.
    *   Harmonized names.
    *   Extracted environmental predictors.
    *   **Outlier Flags**: Columns indicating whether a record was flagged as an outlier (e.g., "Perfect Outlier").

## Conclusion
The **Pan-European Workflow** demonstrates how the AquaINFRA Virtual Environment facilitates complex biodiversity analysis. By integrating the **Specleaner** package into a Galaxy workflow, researchers can:
*   Access fragmented data from multiple sources.
*   Apply robust, ensemble outlier detection methods.
*   Create higher quality datasets for Species Distribution Modeling.

This enhances our ability to monitor and protect freshwater biodiversity across Europe.
