# 2. Intro Aqua VRE (Galaxy & Tools)

The **AquaINFRA Virtual Research Environment (VRE)** is a modular and extensible platform built on established open-source technologies. It serves as the analytical engine of the project, enabling researchers to run complex workflows through a user-friendly interface.

### Key Technologies
- **Galaxy Platform**: A powerful web-based gateway for accessible and reproducible genomic and spatial analysis.
- **Aqua Interaction Platform (AIP)**: Seamlessly search and discover data across Earth observations and European hydrography.
- **Binder & OGC API**: Integrated services for interactive computing and standardized data processing.
- **Language Support**: Native support for **R** and **Python** environments.

### Why use the VRE?
1.  **FAIR Processing**: Workflows developed in our case studies are published via Zenodo with full provenance.
2.  **Cross-Domain Discovery**: Discover aquatic digital resources across disciplines and national borders.
3.  **High-Performance Computing**: Access the resources needed for large-scale spatio-temporal modeling.

> [!TIP]
> Visit the [AquaINFRA VRE Portal](https://aquainfra.dev.52north.org/) to explore community-tailored tools and start your first analysis.
