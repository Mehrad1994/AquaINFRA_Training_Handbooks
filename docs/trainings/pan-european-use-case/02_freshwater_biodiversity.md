# Freshwater Biodiversity & BOKU University

This chapter introduces the Institute of Hydrobiology and Aquatic Ecosystem Management at **BOKU University** in Vienna, Austria, which is leading the development of the Pan-European use case.

## BOKU Univeristy & The Team
**BOKU University** is a "Life Science University" covering topics like forestry, agriculture, and water management.

**[Prof. Florian Borgwardt](https://boku.ac.at/personen/person/5940E26847F9046A)** explains that at his institute, they investigate rivers and their biodiversity in Austria and across Europe. They use:
*   **Fish and Macroinvertebrates** as bioindicators.
*   **Biogeochemical proceses** to understand environmental drivers.

### The Challenge
Freshwater biodiversity is among the most threatened on the planet. Rivers and lakes are sensitive to environmental change, making them a priority for scientific investigation.
*   **Species Occurrence Records** are often used to describe biodiversity (e.g., in Species Distribution Models).
*   However, these records come from different sources with **varying quality**.

> **"It is very important to do quality checks and data quality control first."**

## Outlier Detection
To address data quality, the team developed a workflow for identifying outliers in species occurrence records. This workflow allows researchers to apply a *homogeneous and robust approach* rather than relying on fragmented methods.

It combines **20 different outlier detection methods** into one single approach. This logic is encapsulated in the **Specleaner R Package**, which we will explore in the next chapter.
