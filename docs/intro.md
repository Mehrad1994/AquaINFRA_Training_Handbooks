# 1. Introduction to AquaINFRA

The **AquaINFRA project** (2023–2026) is developing a next-generation virtual environment equipped with **FAIR** (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) multidisciplinary data and services. 

Our mission is to support marine and freshwater scientists and stakeholders in **restoring healthy oceans, seas, coastal, and inland waters** by bridging the gap between isolated research infrastructures and national borders.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Main Resource:** For the most up-to-date project news and developments, visit the official **[AquaINFRA Website](https://aquainfra.eu)**.

### Core Objectives:
- **Marine-Freshwater Integration**: Breaking silos to enable joint collaboration across the entire land-sea continuum.
- **EOSC-Based Infrastructure**: Building a cross-country discovery mechanism as part of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).
- **Spatio-temporal Analysis**: Providing standardized services for biological, chemical, and physical data modeling.
- **Reproducible Science**: Ensuring that every analytical workflow can be shared, reused, and validated by the community.
