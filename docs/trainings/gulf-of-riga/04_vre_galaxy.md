# Virtual Research Environment: Aqua Galaxy

The **Aqua Galaxy** is the dedicated Virtual Research Environment (VRE) for the AquaINFRA project.

## Platform Technicals
*   **Base**: It is a subdomain of the popular **Galaxy platform**, an open-source, web-based platform for data intensive biomedical research which has been adapted here for aquatic sciences.
*   **Purpose**: To allow researchers to store, analyze, and process multidisciplinary FAIR data without needing complex local computing setups.

## Key Features
*   **Tool Repository**: Contains a set of specialized tools for marine and freshwater analysis.
*   **Workflow Management**: Users can import existing workflows (like the Gulf of Riga DGA workflow), run them on their own data, or modify them.
*   **Reproducibility**: Experiments managed in Galaxy are inherently reproducible, recording every step, tool version, and parameter used.
