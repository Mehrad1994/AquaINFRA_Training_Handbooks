## Reviewing Results

Once the workflow finishes, all step boxes turn **green**.

1.  **View Outputs**: Click on the **eye icon (View)** on any step to see the result file.
2.  **Result Files**: Often provided as CSV or text files containing links.
3.  **Final Result**:
    -   Locate the output of the final step.
    -   Download the **CSV file**.

### Content of the Final CSV
The file includes:
-   **Environmental Predictors**: Extracted from raster data (Step 7).
-   **Outlier Classification**: Each record is categorized based on the applied methods:
    -   **Poor**
    -   **Moderate**
    -   **Fair**
    -   **Very Strong**
    -   **Not an Outlier**

## Conclusion

The Pan-European Biodiversity Use Case workflow aims to serve two main user groups:

1.  **Proficient Coders (with limited time)**:
    -   Can use the Specleaner R package directly or via the workflow to quickly process data without writing extensive scripts from scratch.
2.  **Non-Proficient Coders**:
    -   Can access advanced outlier detection (20 methods) with just a few clicks in the Galaxy interface, without needing deep R knowledge.

This includes Bachelor, Master, and PhD students, as well as environmental scientists and researchers.

Although developed for the Pan-European context, this workflow is **globally applicable** for improvements in biodiversity data quality and analysis.
